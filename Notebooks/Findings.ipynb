    "## What it shows:\n",
    "Prices vary far less between neighbourhoods than you’d expect — everything gravitates around £600–£700, regardless of borough.\n",

    "**Key takeaways:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Staten Island Shared Rooms (£715) are oddly the most expensive room type in the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "That screams data anomaly, mispricing, or a landlord with delusions of grandeur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Brooklyn Hotel Rooms (£711) are also unusually high compared with Manhattan hotels (£681).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most stable, predictable area: Manhattan — all room types cluster tightly around £620–£680.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few dodgy entries exist:\n",
    "\n",
    "“brookln” and “manhatan” with a single listing each, due to spelling error\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "There’s a surprising uniformity of pricing across New York. Borough choice explains far less than expected — room type is the stronger driver."
